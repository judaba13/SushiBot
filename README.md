Python Bot that plays the popular flash game Sushi Go Round

You can play the flash game here: http://www.miniclip.com/games/sushi-go-round/en/

Based on the tutorial from: http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-build-a-python-bot-that-can-play-web-games--active-11117

This is my first larger project done in Python in order to learn the language. I generally tried to follow the tutorial above, but added my own features as well.
